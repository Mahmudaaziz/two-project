            <h3> About Us</h3>
            <p><b>Bangladesh</b> is one of the world's most densely-populated countries, with its people living in a delta of rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal.

                Poverty is widespread, but  <b>  Bangladesh </b> has in recent years reduced population growth and improved health and education.
                
                Formerly East Pakistan, Bangladesh came into being only in 1971, when the two parts of Pakistan split after a bitter war which drew in neighbouring India.
                
                 <b> Bangladesh spent 15 years</b> under   <b> military rule</b> and, although democracy was restored in 1990, the political scene remains volatile. Islamist extremism has also been rising in the traditionally tolerant country.
                
                <b> Bangladesh </b> is low-lying and vulnerable to flooding and cyclones. It stands to be badly affected by any rise in sea levels.</p>
